# Forensics Warmup 1

> Can you unzip this file for me and retreive the flag?

> Hints:  
> Make sure to submit the flag as picoCTF{XXXXX}

Upon downloading the file, we can either unzip with the default archive manager, or the unix command `unzip`. Inside the extracted file is `flag.jpg`, which contains the flag as an image.
