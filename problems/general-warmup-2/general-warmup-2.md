# General Warmup 2

> Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

> Hints:
> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was '11111', you would submit 'picoCTF{11111}' as the flag.

This is just a simple change of bases problem. Our flag is:

> `picoCTF{11011}`
