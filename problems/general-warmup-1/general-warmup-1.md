> If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII?

> Hints:
> Submit your answer in our competition's flag format. For example, if you answer was 'hello', you would submit 'picoCTF{hello}' as the flag.

`0x41` in hexadecimal is `A` in ASCII. (We can confirm this either by looking it up online, or running `man ascii`) As per the hint, our flag is:

> `picoCTF{A}`
