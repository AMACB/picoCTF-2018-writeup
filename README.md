# picoCTF 2018 Writeup
Greetings from Team Point Mass!
This is our writeup for picoCTF 2018 competition. Over the next few weeks, we will put solutions to the problems in this repository.

## Notes
### Flag and URL Differences
(Almost) all of the problems will have differening flags or URLs, which are randomly chosen by picoCTF when you register, presumably as a mechanism to prevent cheating. We will not show links in our writeups to avoid confusion; and in scripts, we will put dummy variables for the hostname and port, allowing the reader to fill them in. For flags that may differ, all of the variations of the flag have a general form. For example:

> `picoCTF{3x@mp1e_fl4g_48375435}`  
> `picoCTF{3x@mp1e_fl4g_19584647}`  
> `picoCTF{3x@mp1e_fl4g_34583985}`  
> `picoCTF{3x@mp1e_fl4g_85479822}`

In this case, we will write the flag as such:

> `picoCTF{3x@mp1e_fl4g_########}`
